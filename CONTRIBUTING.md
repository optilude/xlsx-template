How to contribute
=================

Any changes to code is welcome. This project open to any improvements. I want to maintain backward compatibility so we need tests for the new functionality.
This give us all confidence that next release would be just version change.

Any breaking change should be discussed, and most likely would not pass. But there a way. Usually if breaking change warranted, we can create freeze old functionality, and maybe create new classes/functions which will solve our problem.
That allow not break existing customers and improve code. I do not know how properly do that, so please give me a slack on that.

If your PR sitting for too long, ping me (@kant2002) in the PR again to resurrect me from other projects. Maybe I'm slow, but I try to react on all PR.

# Code style
Please avoid changes in whitespaces in functional PRs. If something irks your, create new PR just for code formatting.
